use the brand-new won-xxx messages!
refactor new JPanel, setLayout --> new JPanel(new MyLayout())

maybe?
todo @sound: implement something to play them
todo @Main: implement the restart button
todo @getEnemyNeighbors: optimization, use a bitfield
bug @AiDialog: cancel but looks like selected, though
