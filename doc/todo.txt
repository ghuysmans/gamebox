basic:
- stats; they must use user's game selection (hidden)

- aboutbox
- report
- achievements icons
- sounds?

open users management dialog when no profile exist
selected game without players must be discarded
AI selection dialogs must be pre-filled when modifying
check questions.txt
FIXME's and TODO's
"Recommencer" button (restart)
use antialiasing in BoardPanel!
explain somewhere how to run tests from the console
resync UML with code!

optimization: use a bitfield instead of boolean[]. maybe not (but EXPLAIN!)
make the AI work on an isolated fake Game instance!
create packaging script using Python (or Ant?)
