basic:
- stats
- automatic bot move (mode!)
- aboutbox
- report
- achievements icons
- sounds?

selected game without players must be discarded
check questions.txt
FIXME's and TODO's
"Recommencer" button (restart)
stats must use user's selection (and force AI/AI)
use antialiasing in BoardPanel!
explain somewhere how to run tests from the console
resync UML with code!

optimization: use a bitfield instead of boolean[]. maybe not (but EXPLAIN!)
make the AI work on an isolated fake Game instance!
create packaging script using Python (or Ant?)
